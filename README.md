# Modmail for Discord
A bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) that allows users to DM the bot to contact the server's entire mod team.
These DMs get relayed to a modmail server where each user gets their own channel, or "thread".
Moderators and admins can then reply to these threads, and these responses are relayed back to the original user as a DM.

Inspired by Reddit's modmail system.
